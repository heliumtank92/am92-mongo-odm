This package uses mongoose package using its 8.4.1 version.\nThis package provides the following functionalities:\n\nMongoDB Connection Helper\nMongoose Schema Wrapper\nCollection Modeling Class\n\n\n\nTable of Content\n\nInstallation\nEnvironment Variables\nConnecting to MongoDB\nCreating a Collection Schema\nCreating a Collection Model\nProperties of Model Instance\nMethods of Model Instance\n\n\nResources\nLicense\n\n\n\nInstallation\nExample :npm install --save @am92/mongo-odm\n\nEnvironment Variables\nThe following environment variables need to be set to work with this package:\nExample :##### Mongo Config\nexport MONGO_HOSTS=\nexport MONGO_DBNAME=\nexport MONGO_USER_AUTH=false\nexport MONGO_USERNAME=\nexport MONGO_PASSWORD=\nexport MONGO_REPLICASET=\nexport MONGO_REPLICASET_COUNT=0\nexport MONGO_READ_PREFERENCE=\nexport MONGO_SSL_ENABLED=false\nexport MONGO_SSL_VALIDATE=false\nexport MONGO_PEM_PATH=\nexport MONGO_POOL_SIZE=5Note: Do not export variable 'MONGO_READ_PREFERENCE' if no value is to be set.\n\n\nConnecting to MongoDB\nMongoDB needs to be connected before the 'Model' methods can executed. The connection can be established as shown below:\nExample :import { mongoConnect } from '@am92/mongo-odm'\nawait mongoConnect()\n\nCreating a Collection Schema\nExample :import { buildSchema } from '@am92/mongo-odm'\n\nconst CollectionSchemaObject = {\n  // Schema Properties as defined by mongoose Schema Class\n}\n\nconst schemaOptions = {}  // Schema Options as defined by mongoose Schema Class\n\nconst CollectionSchema = buildSchema(CollectionSchemaObject, schemaOptions)\n\nexport default CollectionSchemabuildSchema() returns an instance of mongoose Schema Class.\nNote: The 'options' object properties to be used is as defined by mongoose Schema Class. By default, buildSchema adds 'timestamps: true' option which can be overriden if needed. You may avoid passing the 'options' object if no extra options are required for a given Schema.\n\n\nUsing mongoose Schema Class\nExample :import { Schema } from '@am92/mongo-odm'\n\nconst SubDocumentSchema = new Schema({\n  // Schema Properties as defined by mongoose Schema Class\n})\n\nexport default SubDocumentSchema\n\nUsing mongoose from @am92/mongo-odm\nExample :import mongoose, { Schema, Types, ObjectId } from '@am92/mongo-odm'\n\nCreating a Collection Model\nExample :import { Model } from '@am92/mongo-odm'\nimport CollectionSchema from './CollectionSchema.mjs'\n\nconst
